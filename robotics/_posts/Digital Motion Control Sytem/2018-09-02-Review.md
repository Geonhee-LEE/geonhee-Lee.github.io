### Introduction

An _n_ th order linear time-invariant(LTI) can be described by a linear constant coefficient differential equation of the form

$$
\begin{aligned}
y^{(n)} +a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + ... + a_1 \dot{y} + a_0 y = b_m u^{(m)} + b_{m-1} u^{(m-1) } +...+ b_1 \dot{u} + b_0 u
\end{aligned}
$$

where apprpriate initial conditions are specified for the output, _y(t)_ of the system. Laplace transforming the above equation, we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
Y(s) = \frac{N(s)}{D(s)} U(s) + \frac{IC(s)}{D(s)} = G(s)U(s) + \frac{IC(s)}{D(s)}
\end{aligned}
$$

where

$$
\begin{aligned}
G(s) = \frac{b_m s^m +b_{m-1} u^{m-1 + ... + b_1 s b_0}}{s^n + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} +...+ a_1 s a_0} = \frac{N(s)}{D(s)}
\end{aligned}
$$

__IC(s)__ : a polynimial in s, a complex variable, containing the terms arising from the initial conditions.

__The total response(Y(s))__: __sum__ of the contributions from the initial conditions and  the system input.


If the system is unforced(i.e., U(s) = 0), we call the resulting response the __zero-input response(ZIR)__ of the system. Likewise, if all initial conditions are zero(i.e., IC(s) = 0), the forcing function produces the __zero-state response(ZSR)__.

### Frequency Responce

- s($$=\sigma + j \omega$$): complex variable, transfer function(G(s)) are also complex.
- complex: can be expressed with a __magnitude__ and __angle__.
- To draw such graph, particularly with the help of a computer 
  - This give us _sinusoidal steady state responce_, which fully characterizes the system.
  - __Frequency response plots__: Plots of magnitude and phase of a transfer function vesus frequency.
  - __Magnitude__: 입력/출력의 신호세기를 보여준다.
    -  -3db가 되는 지점을 bandwidth라 하며 energy level이 절반이 되는 시점이다($$-3 = 20 log (\frac{V_2}{V_1}) = 20 log (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})$$)
    -  작은 입력으로 큰 출력이 발생할 때, 이것은 공진(resonance)이라 하며 sensor에서 많이 사용된다.
   -  __Phase__: 
      -  시간지연을 나타낸다, tracking control을 하기 위해서는 phase를 줄여야만 한다.
      -  stability를 파악할 수 있다, 180도의 위상차(phase margin) 이상은 상당히 위험하다.
      -  저주파일때는 위상차 지연이 크지 않으나, 고주파일때는 위상차 지연이 크게 발생할 수 있다.


### Convolution

- __Convolution__: fundamental concept in systems analysis.
  - Time domain technique that provides the basis for transfer function analysis.
  - __Time domain에서의 convolution__ 은 __frequence domain에서 곱셈__ 과 동일.

- The zero-state response of a linear time invariant system can be represented as $$Y(s) = H(s)X(s)$$
  - where H(s) is the system transfer function. The output, $$Y(s)$$, is the Laplace transform of

$$
\begin{aligned}
y(t) = \int^\infty_{-\infty} h(\tau) x(t-\tau) d\tau = \int^\infty_{-\infty} x(\tau) h(t-\tau) d\tau 
\end{aligned} 
 $$

- The equation can be abbreviated as 

$$
\begin{aligned}
y(t) = h(t) * x(t) = x(t) * h(t)
\end{aligned} 
 $$

- If the input to the system is an __impulse__, $$\delta(t)$$, then X(s) = 1 and
  - This property is used in __system identification__.
  
$$
\begin{aligned}
Y(s) = H(s) \cdot 1 \\
\therefore y(t) = h(t)
\end{aligned} 
 $$

- Higher order systems can also be analyzed using this technique. The transfer function of an _n_ th order system can be expanded as 

$$
\begin{aligned}
H(s) = \frac{R_1}{s-p_1} + ... + \frac{R_n}{s-p_n}
\end{aligned} 
 $$

- An alternative approach is to represent the ___n_ th order system__ with a __first order matrix equation__.


### Stability 

- There are many definition of stability.
- But, we define a stable system as one in which the __output of the system does not grow without bound for any initial condition (natural response) or for any bounded input__. 
- The second type os commonly known as _bounded input-bounded output (BIBO) stability_.


#### Stability of the Zero-Input Response: Asymptotic stability

Consider the __Zero-Input Response__ of a system. 
This is determined only by the __system's characteristic equation__ and __its initial conditions__.
That is,

$$
\begin{aligned}
Y(s) = \frac{IC(s)}{D(s)}
\end{aligned} 
 $$

 Recall that the roots of the __characteristic equation__ are called __system modes__.
 There are 3 possibilities.

 $$1$$. Re($$p_i$$) < 0 for all i

where $$p_i$$ are roots of the characteristic quation. In this case, $$y(t) \rightarrow 0$$ as $$t \rightarrow \infty$$, and the system is __asymptotically stable__.

 $$2$$. Re($$p_i$$) >0 for any i

 Now, $$y(t) \rightarrow \infty$$ as $$t \rightarrow \infty$$, and the system is __unstable__.

 $$3$$. Re($$p_i$$) = 0 for any i

This means that a root of the characteristic equation(system modes) is 0 or purely imaginary. In this case, the output either remains __constant__ or is __sinusoidal__. Therefore, the output neither returns to zero nor goes to infinity. This is known as __marginal stability__.


#### Stability of the Zero-State Response: BIBO stability

The output of a linear time invariant system with general input x(t) is given by the convolution integral

$$
\begin{aligned}
y(t) = \int^\infty_{-\infty} h(\tau) x(t-\tau) d\tau
\end{aligned} 
 $$

If the input is bounded(i.e., |x(t)| $$\leq M < \infty$$), then 

$$
\begin{aligned}
|y(t)| = | \int^\infty_{-\infty} h(\tau) x(t-\tau) d\tau | \leq M | \int^\infty_{-\infty} h(\tau)  d\tau | \leq M  \int^\infty_{-\infty} |h(\tau)| d\tau 
\end{aligned} 
 $$

Therefore, the system if __BIBO stable__ if and only if

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int^\infty_{-\infty} | h(\tau)  | d\tau  < \infty
\end{aligned} 
 $$

> Is a marginally stable system BIBO stable? No
