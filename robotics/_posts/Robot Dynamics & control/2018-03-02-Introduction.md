# Robot Dynamics & control, Lecture1: Introduction

Components & Structure of Robots:
-   Robot manipulators are composed of links connected by __joints__ into a __kinematic chain__.
    -   __Revolute__ joint: allows relative rotation between two links.
    -   __Prismatic__ joint: allows a linear relative motion between two links.
