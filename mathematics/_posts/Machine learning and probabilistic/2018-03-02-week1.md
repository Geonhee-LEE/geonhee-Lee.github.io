### Binomial Distribution

- Binomialdistributionis
  - The __discrete probability distribution__
  - Of the number of successes in a sequence of __n independent yes/no experiments__, and each success has the probability of __$$\theta$$__
  - Also called a Bernoull iexperiment
- Flips are i.i.d
  - Independent events
  - Identically distributed according to binomial distribution 
- P(H) = $$\theta$$, P(T)=1 - $$\theta$$
- P(HHTHT)= $$\theta$$ $$\theta$$ (1- $$\theta$$) $$\theta$$ (1- $$\theta$$)=$$\theta ^3$$  $$(1 - \theta)^2$$
